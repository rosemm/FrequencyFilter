Description: The Frequency Filter, for identifying and exploring patterns
in child speech that cannot be explained by the corresponding frequencies in child-directed speech.
It allows researchers to simultaneously control for and combine language data from the child, the caregiver,
multiple languages, and across multiple time points to make inferences
about what might be driving the shape of development.
