\title{Residualizes child counts by regressing on adult counts for the same words}
\usage{
frequency_filter(data_input, chi.count = "chi.count",
  adu.count = "adu.count", min.types = 200, log = TRUE, base = exp(1),
  drop.zeros = TRUE, outlier_cutoff = 1, debug = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_input}{the dataframe of counts in child and adult speech}

\item{chi.count}{the name of the column with child counts}

\item{adu.count}{the name of the column with adult counts}

\item{min.types}{the minimum number of types necessary to run regression at a given timepoint or transcript. If set to 0, it will attempt to fit a regression for every timepoint/transcript regardless of how many words are available. Note that it is inadvisable to use residuals from regressions fit at very sparse timepoints.}

\item{log}{log transform counts before regressing? Default is TRUE.}

\item{base}{the base to use for log transformation}

\item{drop.zeros}{should zero-count words (words that never occur in adult speech, or never in child speech) be excluded? Default is TRUE, which restricts analysis to counts of words that are observed in both child and adult speech.}

\item{outlier_cutoff}{how should outliers (exceptionally high or low residuals) be defined? Default is 1 SD.}

\item{debug}{turn on to display extra messages while the function runs, useful for identifying problem transcripts. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
The original input data, with new variables added on providing results from the regressions including residual values for each word.
}
\description{
Residualizes child word counts by regressing on counts for the main adult interlocotur for the same words in the same transcripts.
The input data should already be word counts by speaker for each transcript or timepoint. 
By default, counts are log transformed before regressing.
